Reproducible Data Assignment 2
==============================

The goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer two questions about severe weather events:

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the *evtype* variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

# Synopsis

Based on this analysis tornadoes are the number one weather related health threat.
Floods are the number one cause of econmic damage. 
In both cases, the analysis shows that these events far outweigh the impact of
other weather events measured.

This analysis was performed using the NOAA Storm database. Data was grouped and 
summarized by evtype which denotes a specific type of weather event. Health impact
was caclulated by summing the injuries and fatalities caused by each type of weather 
event. Economic impact was determined by summing the total dollar damage to property
and crops for each weather event type.

### Analysis summarizing the data by weather events types:

* Tornados have the most impact on population health causing the most injuries and fatalities.
* Floods generate the most economic damage.
